You can configure your app to subscribe to webhook topics in the following ways:

1. **If your app was created with the Shopify CLI, then use your [app configuration file](/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration)**. This is the recommended method for getting started quickly and for subscribing to webhooks for all shops that your app is installed on.
2. **If your app was created with the Shopify CLI, then you can also use the [GraphQL Admin API](/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/webhookSubscriptionCreate)**. This is most useful in cases where your webhook subscriptions might depend on which shop your app is installed on.
3. **If your app is a [custom app](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/apps/app-types/custom-apps)**, then use the Shopify admin to create your app and manage scopes, and the GraphQL Admin API to subscribe to webhook topics.

Once a subscription has been configured correctly, Shopify will send webhooks to your app with data about events that have occurred on a shop, related to the topics you have subscribed to.

In this section, you will learn about:

* How to quickly get started and create your first webhook subscription
* This includes details about the use cases, trade-offs, and constraints for each. Shopify's recommendations across different subscription mechanisms (using your app configuration file vs. the Admin API), delivery methods (cloud-based vs. HTTPS) and technologies available to you. This includes details about the use cases, trade-offs, and constraints for each.

Info

Webhooks are divided by topic. Refer to the [Webhooks references](/docs/api/webhooks) for the complete list of supported webhook topics.

## [Anchor to App-specific subscriptions](/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe#app-specific-subscriptions)App-specific subscriptions

You can subscribe your app to webhook topics using your app configuration file, rather than using the Admin API. This allows your subscriptions to be configured and managed across all shops that your app is installed on. This also makes subscription configuration and management easy when you are getting started with Shopify's webhooks. Shopify recommends subscribing to webhooks using this approach.

To subscribe your app to webhook topics where the configuration depends on the shop your app is installed on, use the [GraphQL Admin API](/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe/subscribe-using-api).

## [Anchor to App-specific vs. Shop-specific subscriptions](/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe#app-specific-vs-shop-specific-subscriptions)App-specific vs. Shop-specific subscriptions

If you use the Shopify CLI to build your app, then there are important differences to be aware of when configuring app-specific subscriptions using your [app configuration file](/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration) versus configuring shop-specific subscriptions using the [Admin API](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/webhookSubscriptionCreate).

Warning

If you have shop-specific subscriptions already, and are migrating your app to app-specific subscriptions, then make sure you first remove any existing webhook subscriptions to the same topics. This avoids potential conflicts and duplicate notifications.

1. Check the list of existing shop-specific webhook topics your app is subscribed to by using the [GraphQL Admin API `webhookSubscriptions` query](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/webhookSubscriptions).
2. Delete the relevant queries, subscription, and handler code from your app.
3. Deploy a new version of your app by running `shopify app deploy`. You can check that your subscriptions have been deleted by checking the **Versions** page for your app in the Dev Dashboard.
4. Configure your app to subscribe to app-specific subscriptions. Refer to the [create a subscription](/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe/get-started) tutorial to get started.

## [Anchor to Subscribing to topics as a custom app](/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe#subscribing-to-topics-as-a-custom-app)Subscribing to topics as a custom app

Webhooks are available for all custom apps to use. However, custom apps created in the Shopify admin cannot take advantage of the tooling available through the Shopify CLI, including subscribing to webhook topics using the app configuration file.

This means that webhook subscriptions must be set up and configured using the GraphQL Admin API.

1. Create an app in the Shopify Admin and install it on your test shop to get your Admin API Access token.
2. Configure your Admin API scopes by selecting the scopes that you'll need for each webhook topic that you intend to subscribe to. Learn more about which topics require which Shopify scopes in the [Webhooks reference](/docs/api/webhooks).
3. Subscribe to webhook topics [using the Admin API](/docs/apps/build/webhooks/subscribe/subscribe-using-api) and your Admin API access token.
