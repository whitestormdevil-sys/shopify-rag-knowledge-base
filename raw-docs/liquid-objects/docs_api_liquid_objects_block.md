The content and settings of a [section block](/themes/architecture/sections/section-schema#blocks).

Sections and blocks are reusable modules of content that make up [templates](/themes/architecture/templates).

You can include a maxiumum of 50 blocks in a section. To learn more about using blocks, refer to the [Building with sections and blocks](/docs/themes/best-practices/templates-sections-blocks).

## Properties

[Anchor to](/docs/api/liquid/objects/block#block-id) 

id**id** [string](/docs/api/liquid/basics#string)

:   The ID of the block.

    The ID is dynamically generated by Shopify and is subject to change. You should avoid relying on a literal value of this ID.

[Anchor to](/docs/api/liquid/objects/block#block-settings) 

settings**settings**

:   The [settings](/themes/architecture/sections/section-schema#blocks) of the block.

    To learn about how to access settings, refer to [Access settings](/themes/architecture/settings#access-settings). To learn which input settings can be applied to the `type` property within settings, refer to [Input settings](/themes/architecture/settings/input-settings).

[Anchor to](/docs/api/liquid/objects/block#block-shopify_attributes) 

shopify\_attributes**shopify\_attributes** [string](/docs/api/liquid/basics#string)

:   The data attributes for the block for use in the theme editor.

    The theme editor's [JavaScript API](/themes/best-practices/editor/integrate-sections-and-blocks#section-and-block-javascript-events)
    uses the data attributes to identify blocks and listen for events. No value for `block.shopify_attributes` is returned
    outside the theme editor.

[Anchor to](/docs/api/liquid/objects/block#block-type) 

type**type** [string](/docs/api/liquid/basics#string)

:   The type of the block.

    The type is a free-form string that's defined in the [block's schema](/themes/architecture/sections/section-schema#blocks).
    You can use the type as an identifier. For example, you might display different markup based on the block type.
