Our Theme Store is a canvas for creativity, innovation, and merchant expression. We’re looking for unique, original submissions that push design boundaries, offer standout visual quality, and deliver delightful, engaging user experiences. Themes should be visually distinctive, professionally crafted, and empower merchants to tell their brand's story clearly and expressively.
We value themes that not only meet merchants' functional business needs, but also actively inspire merchants and their customers, elevating online shopping experiences through thoughtful layouts, bold visuals, purposeful creativity, and intuitive, high-quality usability.

[Themes and presets](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/config/settings-data-json) published on the Shopify Theme Store must meet all requirements. If your submission misses any requirement, then it will be rejected and you'll need to make corrections before resubmitting.

Test your theme thoroughly before submitting to ensure it meets functionality and quality standards. Poorly tested themes will be rejected without further review, and repeated issues may lead to suspension or permanent rejection.

## [Anchor to 2. Uniqueness from other themes](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#2-uniqueness-from-other-themes)2. Uniqueness from other themes

Your theme must be fundamentally different from other themes on the [Shopify Theme Store](https://themes.shopify.com) (including your own). You must make meaningful design and functional innovations beyond minor cosmetic changes. Clear differentiation builds merchant trust by keeping theme quality high, and helps merchants find the right fit faster.

We use these standards to evaluate uniqueness:

* Uniqueness is measured by the overall experience across core templates and elements. You may reuse components and libraries, but how you assemble them must be substantially different.
* Your theme’s identity and capabilities must not be easily reproducible. They should not be achievable by adjusting settings, superficial styling, or adding a few sections or options to another theme. Reproducing your overall experience should require substantial structural changes to the theme.
* Use an inventive art direction that distinguishes the theme, with clear systems for header and navigation, product cards, media treatments, and page structure.
* Cosmetic or additive alterations are insufficient. For example: spacing tweaks, color or typography swaps, gradients, shape dividers, background effects or blurs, animation or transition tweaks, or adding a few settings or sections to an existing codebase.
* Embed uniqueness at the architectural level so the theme remains unmistakably its own as new settings, sections, and features are added.
* A merchant shouldn't be able to buy your theme then customize it to appear almost identical to a different theme on the Shopify Theme Store.

Note

[Shopify's Skeleton Theme](https://github.com/shopify/skeleton-theme) is the only approved codebase for Theme Store development. Otherwise, themes must be built with fully original code. New theme submissions built on or derived from Dawn or Horizon are not eligible for the Shopify Theme Store.

### [Anchor to Section name guidelines](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#section-name-guidelines)Section name guidelines

Each section in a theme needs a name. Section names appear in the section picker and in the sidebar listing the sections in a template.

Section names should relate to the section's function, for example `Header`, `Product list`, `Slideshow`, or `Image gallery`.

Refer to [Shopify's theme terminology list](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#terminology-requirements) to make sure that you name sections using the right Shopify terms.

Section presets are predefined configurations of sections that merchants start with when adding content.

Preset names should relate to the type of content in the preset, for example `Image and text`, `Map`, `Columns`, or `Blog articles`.

Refer to [Shopify's theme terminology list](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#terminology-requirements) to make sure that you name presets using the right Shopify terms.

#### [Anchor to Content placeholders](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#content-placeholders)Content placeholders

If your preset features images, videos, or icons, then you should display [placeholder content](https://www.shopify.com/ca/partners/blog/placeholder-images) so that the merchant can get a better idea of how the content looks before they add their own media.

In your presets, use the following content placeholders:

| Type of content | Placeholder |
| --- | --- |
| Images that aren't products or collections  Adjacent images without margins | Image icon |
| Lists of logos | Logo icon |

### [Anchor to Theme and preset naming requirements](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#theme-and-preset-naming-requirements)Theme and preset naming requirements

Theme and preset names must be distinct from Shopify products. You can't use the same name as, or similar to, Shopify products, events, or branded content. For example, don't name your theme Shopify, Unite, or Polaris.

### [Anchor to Theme and preset name guidelines](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#theme-and-preset-name-guidelines)Theme and preset name guidelines

Use the following guidelines to help you choose the right name for your theme and presets:

* Summarize, or allude to, the purpose of the theme preset.
* Give the merchant an idea of what to expect when using the theme preset, the core ideas behind the preset, and the preset's target demographic.
* Use a noun for the name. Nouns are more suitable for creating product names that stick, have identity, and create a lasting impression. A noun can better define the focus of the theme, and offer a better understanding of the shopping experience being offered.
* Use a name that's easy to spell and pronounce. This will help merchants with recall and search.
* Work across different dialects. Since some words and phrases can have different meanings in different regions, you should consult with an idiom dictionary.
* Use a name that's different from theme names on different platforms.

### [Anchor to Increasing clarity and discoverability](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#increasing-clarity-and-discoverability)Increasing clarity and discoverability

For clarity and discoverability, consider the following guidelines when naming your theme and preset:

* Don't use trendy names. Trends fade, and theme names should transcend trends.
* Don't use unusual spellings. Not only are unusual spellings more difficult to remember, but they’re also more susceptible to autocorrect errors, and they limit discoverability by merchants.
* Don't use lengthy names. Even if you’re trying to be descriptive, creating a long name can hurt a merchant’s ability to remember what your theme is called.
* Don't use the same name as a theme on a different platform.
* Don't use the same name as an existing theme and preset name.

### [Anchor to Adding presets to your theme zip submission](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#adding-presets-to-your-theme-zip-submission)Adding presets to your theme zip submission

If you have more than one preset, you need to include a unique set of [templates](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#5-templates-sections-and-blocks) showcasing each preset. The contents of these templates should be similar to the [demo store](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#20-demo-stores) it is associated with.

Preset templates need to be included in a `/listings` folder in your theme zip. See the following example of a theme with two presets:

## [Anchor to 19. Theme versions and release notes](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#19-theme-versions-and-release-notes)19. Theme versions and release notes

Theme versions help merchants easily identify which theme they have, so that they can determine which features are available, or if there are more recent versions to update to.

When you submit your theme to the Shopify Theme Store, either for the first time or for an update, the theme needs to have a [version number](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/success/updates#versioning) and [release notes](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/success/updates#release-notes) that highlight the main features of the version.

## [Anchor to 20. Demo stores](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#20-demo-stores)20. Demo stores

Setting up a demo store is a great way to showcase your theme's features and functionality, and to provide merchants with real-world examples of how they can use your theme. A demo store that's beautifully designed and functions flawlessly lets merchants explore and interact with your theme, and helps them understand if your theme is right for them.

To build your demo store, you can use a Shopify [development store](/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/development-stores) free of charge.

Development stores with developer previews enabled can't be transferred. Don't enable any developer previews when creating demo stores.

To avoid potential merchant confusion, demo stores can only showcase elements and functionality that are built into the theme. For example:

* Don't use embedded text or buttons in images, except for the text on physical products, infographics, badges, or instagram images.
* Don't use animated gif images in places where they can be mistaken for theme functionality.
* Don't use apps. In some cases, special consideration applies to free product review apps and [free translation apps](https://apps.shopify.com/categories/store-design-internationalization). If you're showcasing multi-language options using translation apps, then all content must be translated.

You must obtain the appropriate rights for all demo store assets in accordance with the [Shopify Partner Agreement](https://www.shopify.com/ca/partners/terms#:~:text=Each%20Theme%20Developer,any%20third%20party.).

* Identify the source of any product images used in the product description.
* Use the latest version of your theme in your demo store.
* Incorporate built-in Shopify features to showcase the power and capabilities of your theme.
* Illustrate the versatility and variability of your theme, by including examples such as a product that's on sale, a sold-out product or variant, a product with multiple variants, and a gift card product.

### [Anchor to Contact forms](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#contact-forms)Contact forms

Your contact form lets merchants contact you. You should include your contact form in your theme documentation. If you use a modal for your contact form, then make sure that it's mobile friendly and linkable from the Theme Store. Try to avoid fields that ask merchants about budget, phone numbers, project type, or other unnecessary questions. You can have a form outlining your agency work on a separate page, but the contact form that you link to from the Theme Store should comply with the following guidelines.

| Field | Guideline |
| --- | --- |
| (First and Last) Name Field |  |
| Email Address Field |  |
| Store URL Field | Include an example URL for clarity, such as <http://www.storename.myshopify.com>. |

* For `link_list` settings in the Header or Footer, always set a default value of `main-menu` or `footer`, depending on the location of the setting.
* When providing default values for resource-based settings (such as products), make sure the referenced resources exist in all stores.
* For `metaobject` and `metaobject_list` settings, only standard definitions can be used as the `metaobject_type`. Custom or app-owned definitions aren't supported.

### [Anchor to Estimating the support workload](/docs/storefronts/themes/store/requirements#estimating-the-support-workload)Estimating the support workload

Being a Theme Partner is a full-time job, and supporting merchants who use your theme is a large part of that. All of our current Theme Partners have dedicated support teams working for them. If you become a Theme Partner, then you’ll need to consider how to balance Theme Partner work with any other jobs that you're currently doing. New Theme Partners typically underestimate the amount of time that they'll need to allocate to support.

To understand how much effort is required to support a theme, Shopify merchants currently generate thousands of support tickets each month for the paid themes in the Shopify Theme Store, and support requests continue to grow as more merchants join the platform.
