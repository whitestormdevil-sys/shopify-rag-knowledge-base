To qualify for the Shopify App Store, your app must meet the requirements listed below. Each requirement in this list helps your app meet our app quality standards. Some requirements are general and apply to all apps, and others apply to [specific categories of apps](#category-specific).

These requirements are subject to change, as we're continuously making improvements to the Shopify App Store and developer platform. The App Excellence Team conducts [quality checks](/docs/apps/launch/app-store-review/app-quality-checks) regularly. Your app is expected to meet any new requirements that are added here. The Shopify App Review team can reject an app at their discretion if it doesn't meet the set standards.

## 1. Policy

All Shopify App Store apps must comply with the [Partner Program Agreement](https://www.shopify.com/ca/partners/terms). Partners should act in good faith and in the best interests of merchants and buyers. Partners should not intentionally circumvent critical platform functionality.

Shopify requires apps to be secure, truthful, and privacy-safe, operating within—not around—Shopify’s core systems. Apps that circumvent core workflows or provide unapproved services (such as unauthorized payments, marketplaces, agency brokering, content copying, refunds, or lending) aren’t allowed.
