Customers should be able to easily discover store content. To help with this, you can implement the following methods in your theme:

* [Store navigation](/docs/storefronts/themes/navigation-search/navigation): Merchants can create menus that highlight store content, which can be featured in places like the header and footer to allow customers to easily browse content.
* [Search functionality](/docs/storefronts/themes/navigation-search/search): Customers are often looking for something specific, so you should provide the option to search the store directly, rather than make customers manually navigate to find what they're looking for.
* [Filtering](/docs/storefronts/themes/navigation-search/filtering): Merchants can add filtering to collection and search pages to allow customers to further specify the content they want to browse.
