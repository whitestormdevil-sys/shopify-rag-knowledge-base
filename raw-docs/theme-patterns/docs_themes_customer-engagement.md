Interacting with customers is an important part of running a business for merchants. These interactions can include [collecting additional information from customers](/docs/storefronts/themes/customer-engagement/additional-customer-information) when they create an account, [getting consent for email marketing](/docs/storefronts/themes/customer-engagement/email-consent) to help turn customers into repeat purchasers, and having a [contact form](/docs/storefronts/themes/customer-engagement/add-contact-form) to allow customers to get in touch with the merchant.
