Being able to clearly see pricing and [discounts](/docs/storefronts/themes/pricing-payments/discounts), as well as payment options, are important factors for customers making purchases from a merchant's store.

Some merchants might sell products in specific quantities or measurements, or as part of a selling plan. To support this, Shopify provides merchants the option to set up [unit pricing](/docs/storefronts/themes/pricing-payments/unit-pricing), as well as [Subscriptions](/docs/storefronts/themes/pricing-payments/subscriptions) and [Pre-orders and Try before you buy](/docs/storefronts/themes/pricing-payments/preorder-tbyb).

To help make the payment process easier, Shopify integrates with payment providers that can offer [accelerated checkouts](/docs/storefronts/themes/pricing-payments/accelerated-checkout), and some merchants can utilize Shop Pay to allow customers to pay in [installments](/docs/storefronts/themes/pricing-payments/installments).
