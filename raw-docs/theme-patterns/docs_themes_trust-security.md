Trust and security are important aspects of a theme for both merchants, and customers.

To help protect merchants from spam, Shopify [uses captcha](/docs/storefronts/themes/trust-security/captcha) on customer, contact, and blog comment forms.

To help assure customers that a merchant's shop is secure, Shopify offers [security badges](/docs/storefronts/themes/trust-security/security-badges) that can be linked to Shopify documentation on Payment Card Industry (PCI) standard compliance.
