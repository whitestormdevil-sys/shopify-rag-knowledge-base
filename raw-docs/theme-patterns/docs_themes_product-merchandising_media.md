In addition to images, merchants can upload 3D models and videos, and attach YouTube or Vimeo videos as product media. This gives merchants the opportunity to offer a rich and immersive product experience.

You can display media in a theme using the following Liquid objects and filters:

* [external\_video](/docs/api/liquid/objects/external_video)
* [video](/docs/api/liquid/objects/video)
* [video\_source](/docs/api/liquid/objects/video_source)
* [model](/docs/api/liquid/objects/model)
* [model\_source](/docs/api/liquid/objects/model_source)
* [media filters](/docs/api/liquid/filters/media-filters)
