Shopify’s Ajax API can be used in [Shopify themes](/docs/storefronts/themes) to carry out actions like adding items to the cart, and displaying suggested products without requiring any page refreshes from buyers.

The Ajax API includes the following endpoints:

* [**Cart**](/docs/api/ajax/reference/cart) - Update cart line items, attributes, and notes.
* [**Product**](/docs/api/ajax/reference/product) - Fetch information about any product in the catalog.
* [**Product Recommendations**](/docs/api/ajax/reference/product-recommendations) - Display recommended products on product pages.
* [**Predictive Search**](/docs/api/ajax/reference/predictive-search) - Suggest products, collections, pages and articles to buyers as they type their search queries.
