Tip

For more information on how to configure your access scopes, refer to [app configuration](/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration) and [manage access scopes](/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/app-installation/manage-access-scopes).

**Tip:**

For more information on how to configure your access scopes, refer to [app configuration](/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration) and [manage access scopes](/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/app-installation/manage-access-scopes).

After you've [generated API credentials](/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/client-secrets), your app needs to [be authorized to access store data](/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization#authorization).

Authorization is the process of giving permissions to apps. Users can authorize Shopify apps to access data in a store. For example, an app might be authorized to access orders and product data in a store.

An app can request authenticated or unauthenticated access scopes.

| Scope type | Description | Example use cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Authenticated](#authenticated-access-scopes) | Controls access to resources in the [GraphQL Admin API](/docs/api/admin-graphql), [Web Pixel API](/docs/api/web-pixels-api), and [Payments Apps API](/docs/api/payments-apps).   Authenticated access is intended for interacting with a store on behalf of a user. | * Creating products * Managing discount codes |
| [Unauthenticated](#unauthenticated-access-scopes) | Controls an app's access to [Storefront API](/docs/api/storefront) objects.   Unauthenticated access is intended for interacting with a store on behalf of a customer. | * Viewing products * Initiating a checkout |
| [Customer](#customer-access-scopes) | Controls an app's access to [Customer Account API](/docs/api/customer) objects.   Customer access is intended for interacting with data that belongs to a customer. | * Viewing orders * Updating customer details |

## [Anchor to Authenticated access scopes](/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#authenticated-access-scopes)Authenticated access scopes

This section describes the authenticated access scopes that your app can request. In the table, access to some resources are marked with **permissions required**. In these cases, you must [request specific permission](#requesting-specific-permissions) to access data from the user in your Partner Dashboard.

Info

To authenticate an admin-created custom app, you or the app user needs to install the app from the Shopify admin to generate API credentials and the necessary API access tokens. Refer to [access scopes for admin-created custom apps](/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/access-tokens/generate-app-access-tokens-admin#permissions-required-to-assign-scopes-to-a-custom-app).

### [Anchor to Requesting specific permissions](/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#requesting-specific-permissions)Requesting specific permissions

Follow the procedures below to request specific permissions to request access scopes in the Partner Dashboard.

#### [Anchor to Orders permissions](/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#orders-permissions)Orders permissions

By default, you have access to the last 60 days' worth of orders for a store. To access all the orders, you need to request access to the `read_all_orders` scope from the user:

1. From the Partner Dashboard, go to [**Apps**](https://partners.shopify.com/current/apps).
2. Click the name of your app.
3. Click **API access**.
4. In the **Access requests** section, on the **Read all orders scope** card, click **Request access**.
5. On the **Orders** page that opens, describe your app and why you're applying for access.
6. Click **Request access**.

If Shopify approves your request, then you can add the `read_all_orders` scope to your app along with `read_orders` or `write_orders`.

#### [Anchor to Subscription APIs permissions](/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#subscription-apis-permissions)Subscription APIs permissions

Subscription apps let users sell subscription products that generate multiple orders on a specific billing frequency.

With subscription products, the app user isn't required to get customer approval for each subsequent order after the initial subscription purchase. As a result, your app needs to request the required protected access scopes to use Subscription APIs from the app user:

1. From the Partner Dashboard, go to [**Apps**](https://partners.shopify.com/current/apps).
2. Click the name of your app.
3. Click **API access**.
4. In the **Access requests** section, on the **Access Subscriptions APIs** card, click **Request access**.
5. On the **Subscriptions** page that opens, describe why you're applying for access.
6. Click **Request access**.

If Shopify approves your request, then you can add the `read_customer_payment_methods` and `write_own_subscription_contracts` scopes to your app. If you're using the Customer Account API, you can add the `customer_read_own_subscription_contracts` or `customer_write_own_subscription_contracts` scopes.

#### [Anchor to Protected customer data permissions](/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#protected-customer-data-permissions)Protected customer data permissions

By default, apps don't have access to any protected customer data. To access protected customer data, you must meet our [protected customer data requirements](/docs/apps/launch/protected-customer-data#requirements). You can add the relevant scopes to your app, but the API won't return data from non-development stores until your app is configured and approved for protected customer data use.

## [Anchor to Unauthenticated access scopes](/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#unauthenticated-access-scopes)Unauthenticated access scopes

Unauthenticated access scopes provide apps with read-only access to the [Storefront API](/docs/api/storefront). Unauthenticated access is intended for interacting with a store on behalf of a customer. For example, an app might need to do one or more of following tasks:

* Read products and collections
* Create customers and update customer accounts
* Query international prices for products and orders
* Interact with a cart during a customer's session
* Initiate a checkout

### [Anchor to Request scopes](/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#request-scopes)Request scopes

To request unauthenticated access scopes for an app, select them when you [generate API credentials](/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/client-secrets) or [change granted access scopes](/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/app-installation/manage-access-scopes).

To request access scopes or permissions for the Headless channel, refer to [managing the Headless channel](/docs/storefronts/headless/building-with-the-storefront-api/manage-headless-channels#request-storefront-permissions).

You can request the following unauthenticated access scopes:

Unauthenticated access scopes

| Scope | Access |
| --- | --- |
| `unauthenticated_read_checkouts`, `unauthenticated_write_checkouts` | [Cart](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/cart) object |
| `unauthenticated_read_customers`, `unauthenticated_write_customers` | [Customer](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/customer) object |
| `unauthenticated_read_customer_tags` | `tags` field on the [Customer](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/customer) object |
| `unauthenticated_read_content` | Storefront content, such as [Article](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/article), [Blog](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/blog), and [Comment](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/comment) objects |
| `unauthenticated_read_metaobjects` | View metaobjects, such as [Metaobject](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/metaobject) |
| `unauthenticated_read_product_inventory` | `quantityAvailable` field on the [ProductVariant](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/productvariant) object and `totalAvailable` field on the [Product](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/product) object |
| `unauthenticated_read_product_listings` | [Product](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/product) and [Collection](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/collection) objects |
| `unauthenticated_read_product_pickup_locations` | [Location](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/location) and [StoreAvailability](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/storeavailability) objects |
| `unauthenticated_read_product_tags` | `tags` field on the [Product](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/product) object |
| `unauthenticated_read_selling_plans` | Selling plan content on the [Product](/docs/api/storefront/latest/objects/product) object |

## [Anchor to Customer access scopes](/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#customer-access-scopes)Customer access scopes

Customer access scopes provide apps with read and write access to the [Customer Account API](/docs/api/customer). Customer access is intended for interacting with data that belongs to a customer. For example, an app might need to do one or more of following tasks:

* Read customers orders
* Update customer accounts
* Create and update customer addresses
* Read shop, customer or order metafields

### [Anchor to Request scopes](/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#request-scopes)Request scopes

To request access scopes or permissions for the Headless or Hydrogen channel, refer to [managing permissions](/docs/storefronts/headless/building-with-the-customer-account-api/getting-started#step-2-configure-customer-account-api-access).

You can request the following customer access scopes:

Customer access scopes

| Scope | Access |
| --- | --- |
| `customer_read_customers`, `customer_write_customers` | [Customer](/docs/api/customer/latest/objects/Customer) object |
| `customer_read_orders`, `customer_write_orders` | [Order](/docs/api/customer/latest/objects/Order) object |
| `customer_read_draft_orders` | [Draft Order](/docs/api/customer/latest/objects/DraftOrder) object |
| `customer_read_markets` | [Market](/docs/api/customer/latest/objects/Market) object |
| `customer_read_metaobjects` | [Metaobject](/docs/api/customer/unstable/objects/metaobject) object |
| `customer_read_store_credit_accounts` | [Store Credit Account](/docs/api/customer/latest/objects/StoreCreditAccount) object |
| `customer_read_own_subscription_contracts`, `customer_write_own_subscription_contracts` | [Subscription Contract](/docs/api/customer/latest/objects/SubscriptionContract) object for records that belong to your app |
| `customer_write_subscription_contracts` | [Subscription Contract](/docs/api/customer/latest/objects/SubscriptionContract) object for all records. Only available for Hydrogen and Headless storefronts |
| `customer_read_companies`, `customer_write_companies` | [Company](/docs/api/customer/latest/objects/Company) object |
| `customer_read_locations`, `customer_write_locations` | [Company Location](/docs/api/customer/latest/objects/CompanyLocation) object |

---

## [Anchor to Checking granted access scopes](/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#checking-granted-access-scopes)Checking granted access scopes

You can check your app's granted access scopes using the [`appInstallation`](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/appInstallation?example=Get+the+access+scopes+associated+with+the+app+installation) query in the GraphQL Admin API.

---

## [Anchor to Limitations](/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#limitations)Limitations

* Apps should request only the minimum amount of data that's necessary for an app to function when using a Shopify API. Shopify restricts access to scopes for apps that don't require legitimate use of the associated data.
* Only [public or custom apps](/docs/apps/launch/distribution) are granted access scopes. Legacy app types, such as private or unpublished, won't be granted new access scopes.
