The Predictive Search API can be used to display predictive search results for queries, products, collections, pages, and articles.

To learn how to use predictive search in a theme, refer to [Add predictive search to your theme](/docs/storefronts/themes/navigation-search/search/predictive-search).

All Ajax API requests should use [locale-aware URLs](/docs/api/ajax#locale-aware-urls) to give visitors a consistent experience.

### [Anchor to Query parameters](/docs/api/ajax/reference/predictive-search#query-parameters)Query parameters

| Query parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `q` | Yes | The search query. |
| `resources[type]` | No | Specifies the type of results requested.  The following are the accepted values, which can be combined in a comma-separated list:   * `product` * `page` * `article` * `collection` * `query`   The default value is `query,product,collection,page`.  To change the default value, you can use [Search Settings](https://help.shopify.com/manual/online-store/search-and-discovery/settings) in the Search & Discovery app. |
| `resources[limit]` | No | Limits the number of results based on `limit_scope`.  The value can range from `1` to `10`, and the default is `10`. |
| `resources[limit_scope]` | No | Decides the distribution of results.  The following are the accepted values:   * `all`: Return results up to `limit` across all types. * `each`: Return results up to `limit` per type.   The default value is `all`. |
| `resources[options][unavailable_products]` | No | Specifies whether to display results for unavailable products.  The following are the accepted values:   * `show`: Show unavailable products. * `hide`: Hide unavailable products. * `last`: Show unavailable products below other matching results.   The default value is `last`.  To change the default value, you can use [Search Settings](https://help.shopify.com/manual/online-store/search-and-discovery/settings) in the Search & Discovery app.  This parameter is only applicable to type `product`. |
| `resources[options][fields]` | No | Specifies the list of resource fields to search.  The following are the accepted values:   * `author` * `body` * `product_type` * `tag` * `title` * `variants.barcode` * `variants.sku` * `variants.title` * `vendor`   The default fields searched on are `title`, `product_type`, `variants.title`, and `vendor`. For the best search experience, you should search on the default field set. |

* `featured_image`
* `image`
* `url`
  For example, a store has a snowboard with a blue variant and a light blue variant. If you search for `snowbo`, then only the snowboard product is returned. However, if you search for `light blue snowbo`, then the snowboard product is returned with the light blue variant.

Note

For the `product` resources type, if the query matches terms specific to a variant's title, the following [`product` object](/docs/api/liquid/objects/product) fields will match those of the variant:

* `featured_media`
* `url`
  For example, a store has a snowboard with a blue variant and a light blue variant. If you search for `snowbo`, then the snowboard product is returned showing the featured media and URL for the snowboard product. However, if you search for `light blue snowbo`, then the snowboard product is returned showing the featured media and URL for the light blue variant.

## [Anchor to Searchable properties](/docs/api/ajax/reference/predictive-search#searchable-properties)Searchable properties

Search results are based on different searchable properties, depending on the resource `type` that you include in your query.

| Resource type | Searchable properties |
| --- | --- |
| Products | * `body` * `product_type` * `tag` * `title` * `variants.barcode` * `variants.sku` * `variants.title` * `vendor` |
| Pages | * `author` * `body` * `title` |
| Articles | * `author` * `body` * `tag` * `title` |
| Collections | * `title` |

### [Anchor to Searchable translations](/docs/api/ajax/reference/predictive-search#searchable-translations)Searchable translations

When searching a translated storefront, you can search the following properties:

| Resource type | Searchable translations |
| --- | --- |
| Products | * `body` * `title` * `variants.title` |
| Pages | * `body` * `title` |
| Articles | * `body` * `title` |

---

## [Anchor to Typo tolerance](/docs/api/ajax/reference/predictive-search#typo-tolerance)Typo tolerance

Predictive search includes typo tolerance, which lets search terms containing typos return the correct matching search results.

Typo tolerance is set to `1`, which means that search displays results that differ from the search term by 1 letter, or results that have 2 letters in a different order. The first 4 letters of a search term need to be entered correctly for typo tolerance to take effect.

The following fields support typo tolerance:

| Resource type | Fields supporting typo tolerance |
| --- | --- |
| Products | * `title` * `product_type` * `variants.title` * `vendor` |
| Pages | * `author` * `title` |
| Articles | * `author` * `title` |
| Collections | * `title` |

### [Anchor to Partial word matches](/docs/api/ajax/reference/predictive-search#partial-word-matches)Partial word matches

Predictive search supports partial word matches. This means that it suggests results even if the word you've entered is still incomplete. For example, if you enter `sweate`, then you might see a suggested search result for `sweater`.

Predictive search has the following limitations when it applies partial word matches:

* If a search query has more than one term, then partial word matches are applied only to the last term in the query.
* Partial word matches are applied only to the end of a search term. For example, if you enter `book`, then you won't see a suggested search result for `ebook`.
* Partial word matches are supported only for themes using specific languages. For more details, refer to [Requirements and limitations](#requirements-and-limitations).

Predictive search uses a different search engine than storefront search. Because of this, it doesn't handle partial word matches in the same way. Although predictive search supports partial word matches, storefront search supports them only if the [prefix option parameter](/docs/storefronts/themes/navigation-search/search#query-parameters) is set to `last`.

---

## [Anchor to Requirements and limitations](/docs/api/ajax/reference/predictive-search#requirements-and-limitations)Requirements and limitations

This section contains information about how predictive search is supported, and any current limitations.

### [Anchor to Supported languages](/docs/api/ajax/reference/predictive-search#supported-languages)Supported languages

Predictive search is supported when the customer's online store session (`buyer locale`) is in one of the following supported languages:

* Afrikaans
* Albanian
* Armenian
* Bosnian
* Bulgarian
* Catalan
* Croatian
* Czech
* Danish
* Dutch
* English
* Estonian
* Faroese
* Finnish
* French
* Gaelic
* German
* Greek
* Hungarian
* Icelandic
* Indonesian
* Italian
* Latin
* Latvian
* Lithuanian
* Macedonian
* Moldovan
* Norwegian
* Norwegian (Bokmål)
* Norwegian Nynorsk
* Polish
* Portuguese (Brazil)
* Portuguese (Portugal)
* Romanian
* Russian
* Serbian
* Serbo-Croatian
* Slovak
* Slovenian
* Spanish
* Swedish
* Turkish
* Ukrainian
* Vietnamese
* Welsh

A script tag in the `<head>` section indicates whether predictive search is supported for the theme language: `<script id="shopify-features"></script>`. This script tag includes a JSON-encoded `predictiveSearch` key with a boolean value. When it's set to `true`, the theme language is supported, and predictive search is enabled. Otherwise, it's set to `false`.

### [Anchor to Limitations](/docs/api/ajax/reference/predictive-search#limitations)Limitations

* Individual products can't be excluded from predictive search results. If a product is hidden from search engines and sitemaps with the metafield `seo.hidden`, then it won't appear in predictive search results. Learn more about [hiding resources with this metafield](/docs/apps/build/marketing-analytics/optimize-storefront-seo#step-2-hide-a-resource-from-search-engines-and-sitemaps).
* The API returns no more than 10 predictive suggestions per request type.
* Collection suggestions are based on the store's primary language. A customer's search won't be compared to a collection's translated content.
* Query suggestions are available in English only, and require the store's primary language (`shop primary locale`) and the customer's online store session (`buyer locale`) to be in English.
