# Event

Ask assistant

Events are generated by some Shopify resources when certain actions are completed, such as the creation of an article, the fulfillment of an order, or the addition of a product. By requesting events, your app can know when certain actions have occurred in the shop.

Note

The events returned by the Event resource should not be considered to be realtime. Events might not be created until a few seconds after the action occurs. In rare cases it can take up to a few minutes for some events to appear.

**Note:**
