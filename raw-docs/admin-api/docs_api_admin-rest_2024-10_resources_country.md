The Country resource represents the tax rates applied to orders from the different countries where a shop sells its products.

![](/assets/api/reference/country.png)

Merchants select the countries where they sell their products when they set up their shipping zones and rates on the **Shipping** page of the Shopify admin. After adding a country to a shipping zone, store owners can then verify and adjust tax rates for each country on the **Taxes** page.

The Country resource lets you access the countries and tax rates set up by the merchant. The countries list includes a default entry called **Rest of World**, which represents all non-specified countries.

You can use the Country resource to modify the sales tax rate for a country or sub-region to account for surtaxes or exemptions that apply to the store.

For more information on managing tax rates for sub-regions of a country, such as states or provinces, see the [Province](/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/store-properties/province) resource.

Caution

As of version 2020-10, you can no longer create or update custom tax values for the Country resource.
