Requires `read_orders` access scope, `read_marketplace_orders` access scope or `read_quick_sale` access scope.

The `Order` object represents a customer's request to purchase one or more products from a store. Use the `Order` object to handle the complete purchase lifecycle from checkout to fulfillment.

Use the `Order` object when you need to:

* Display order details on customer account pages or admin dashboards.
* Create orders for phone sales, wholesale customers, or subscription services.
* Update order information like shipping addresses, notes, or fulfillment status.
* Process returns, exchanges, and partial refunds.
* Generate invoices, receipts, and shipping labels.

The `Order` object serves as the central hub connecting customer information, product details, payment processing, and fulfillment data within the GraphQL Admin API schema.

---

Note

Only the last 60 days' worth of orders from a store are accessible from the `Order` object by default. If you want to access older records,
then you need to [request access to all orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#orders-permissions). If your app is granted
access, then you can add the `read_all_orders`, `read_orders`, and `write_orders` scopes.

## [Anchor to Queries](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#queries)Queries

* order (Order)
* orderByIdentifier (Order)
* orders (OrderConnection!)

[Anchor to order](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#query-order)[order](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/order) •query
:   The `order` query retrieves an [order](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/order) by its ID. This query provides access to comprehensive order information such as customer details, line items, financial data, and fulfillment status.

    Use the `order` query to retrieve information associated with the following processes:

    * [Order management and fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/order-management-apps)
    * [Financial reporting](https://help.shopify.com/manual/finance)
    * [Customer purchase history](https://help.shopify.com/manual/reports-and-analytics/shopify-reports/report-types/default-reports/customers-reports) and [transaction analysis](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/billing/view-charges-earnings#transaction-data-through-the-graphql-admin-api)
    * [Shipping](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/delivery-shipping) and [inventory management](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/inventory-management-apps)

    You can only retrieve the last 60 days worth of orders from a store by default. If you want to access older orders, then you need to [request access to all orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes#orders-permissions).

    For large order datasets, consider using [bulk operations](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/bulk-operations/queries).
    Bulk operations handle pagination automatically and allow you to retrieve data asynchronously without being constrained by API rate limits.
    Learn more about [creating orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/ordercreate) and [building order management apps](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment).

[Anchor to orderMarkAsPaid](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#mutation-orderMarkAsPaid)[orderMarkAsPaid](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderMarkAsPaid) •mutation
:   Marks an order as paid by recording a payment transaction for the outstanding amount.

    Use the `orderMarkAsPaid` mutation to record payments received outside the standard checkout
    process. The `orderMarkAsPaid` mutation is particularly useful in scenarios where:

    * Orders were created with manual payment methods (cash on delivery, bank deposit, money order)
    * Payments were received offline and need to be recorded in the system
    * Previously authorized payments need to be captured manually
    * Orders require manual payment reconciliation due to external payment processing

    The mutation validates that the order can be marked as paid before processing.
    An order can be marked as paid only if it has a positive outstanding balance and its
    [financial status](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#field-Order.fields.displayFinancialStatus)
    isn't already `PAID`. The mutation will either create a new sale transaction for the full
    outstanding amount or capture an existing authorized transaction, depending on the order's current payment state.

    After successfully marking an order as paid, the order's financial status is updated to
    reflect the payment, and payment events are logged for tracking and analytics
    purposes.

[Anchor to orderUpdate](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#mutation-orderUpdate)[orderUpdate](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderUpdate) •mutation
:   Updates the attributes of an order, such as the customer's email, the shipping address for the order,
    tags, and [metafields](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/custom-data) associated with the order.

    If you need to make significant updates to an order, such as adding or removing line items, changing
    quantities, or modifying discounts, then use
    the [`orderEditBegin`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderEditBegin)
    mutation instead. The `orderEditBegin` mutation initiates an order editing session,
    allowing you to make multiple changes before finalizing them. Learn more about using the `orderEditBegin`
    mutation to [edit existing orders](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/orders-fulfillment/order-management-apps/edit-orders).

    If you need to remove a customer from an order, then use the [`orderCustomerRemove`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderCustomerRemove)
    mutation instead.

[Anchor to refundCreate](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#mutation-refundCreate)[refundCreate](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/refundCreate) •mutation
:   Creates a refund for an order, allowing you to process returns and issue payments back to customers.

    Use the `refundCreate` mutation to programmatically process refunds in scenarios where you need to
    return money to customers, such as when handling returns, processing chargebacks, or correcting
    order errors.

    The `refundCreate` mutation supports various refund scenarios:

    * Refunding line items with optional restocking
    * Refunding shipping costs
    * Refunding duties and import taxes
    * Refunding additional fees
    * Processing refunds through different payment methods
    * Issuing store credit refunds (when enabled)

    You can create both full and partial refunds, and optionally allow over-refunding in specific
    cases.

    After creating a refund, you can track its status and details through the order's
    [`refunds`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#field-Order.fields.refunds)
    field. The refund is associated with the order and can be used for reporting and reconciliation purposes.

    The refunding behavior of the `refundCreate` mutation is similar to the
    [`refundReturn`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/returnRefund)
    mutation. The key difference is that the `refundCreate` mutation lets you to specify restocking behavior
    for line items, whereas the `returnRefund` mutation focuses solely on handling the financial refund without
    any restocking input.
