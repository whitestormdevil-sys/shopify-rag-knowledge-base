# Theme

Ask assistant

Requires `themes` access scope.

**Requires `themes` access scope.:**

A theme controls the look and feel of a Shopify online store.

![](/assets/api/reference/theme.png)

A store can have a maximum of 20 themes, one of which is the published theme that customers see when they visit the online store. Customers can't see unpublished themes. When you publish a theme, the previously published theme becomes unpublished.

To modify theme files after they're uploaded, use the [Asset](/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/online-store/asset) resource. To learn how to create your own theme, refer to [*Building themes*](/concepts/themes)
