The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

**Important:** 


The REST Checkout API is deprecated as of version 2024-07.
Please see the [developer changelog](https://shopify.dev/changelog/deprecation-of-checkout-apis) for more information.

If you're building an app with the [Sales Channel SDK](/docs/apps/channels), then you can use
the Checkout API to let customers purchase products from Shopify stores that have installed your sales channel.

Shopify uses the Checkout resource to manage a user's cart as it transitions to a paid order. This process includes
specifying which line items are included in the checkout, attaching a customer's shipping and payment details, and
calculating tax and shipping rates. Credit card payments can be attached to a Checkout using the
[Payment](/docs/api/admin-rest/current/resources/payment) resource.

#### Note

You can't use the Checkout API to create a new checkout user experience for an individual store. For that you
need to use an SDK that's powered by the [Storefront API](/docs/api/storefront) instead, such as the
[JavaScript Buy](/docs/custom-storefronts/additional-sdks/js-buy), [iOS Buy](/docs/custom-storefronts/mobile-kit/buy-sdk-ios), and
[Android Buy](/docs/custom-storefronts/mobile-kit/buy-sdk-android) SDKs.

## [Anchor to GET request, Retrieves a list of shipping rates](/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/checkout#get-checkouts-token-shipping-rates) get Retrieves a list of shipping rates deprecated**deprecated**

Retrieves a list of available shipping rates for the specified checkout. Implementers need to poll this endpoint until rates become available.

Each shipping rate contains the checkout's new subtotal price, total tax, and total price in the event that this shipping rate is selected. This can be used to update the UI without performing further API requests.To apply a shipping rate, update the checkout's shipping line with the handle of the selected rate.
