Listing, creating, updating, and deleting products is deprecated as of REST API 2024-04. For more information, refer to the [guide to the new product model](/docs/api/admin/migrate/new-product-model).

The Product resource lets you update and create products in a merchant's store. You can use [product variants](/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/product-variant) with the Product resource to create or update different versions of the same product. You can also add or update [product images](/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/product-image).

You can add products to collections with the [CustomCollection](/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/customcollection) resource and the [SmartCollection](/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/products/smartcollection) resource.
