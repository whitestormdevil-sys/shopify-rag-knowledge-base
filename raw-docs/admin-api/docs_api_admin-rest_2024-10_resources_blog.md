The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Blog

Requires `content` access scope.

**Requires `content` access scope.:**

In addition to an online storefront, Shopify shops come with a built-in blogging engine, allowing a shop to have one or more blogs.

![](/assets/api/reference/blog.png)

Shop owners are encouraged to use blogs to:

* Make announcements
* Talk about their products in more detail
* Show off their expertise
* Connect with their customers and
* Boost their shop's search engine rankings

Shopify blogs are like most other blogs: a content management system for articles posted in reverse chronological order. Articles can be posted under one or more user-defined categories and tagged with one or more user-defined tags, with an option to allow readers to post comments to articles. An Atom feed is automatically generated for each blog, allowing for syndication. The search functionality built into every shop also searches the text in blog articles.

Blogs are meant to be used as a type of magazine or newsletter for the shop, with content that changes over time. If your shop needs a static page (such as an "About Us" page), we recommend that you use a Page instead.

Also see the [Article resource](/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/online-store/article) for managing blog articles.

path](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/BlogFeed#field-BlogFeed.fields.path)

FeedBurner is a web feed management provider and can be enabled to provide custom RSS feeds for Shopify bloggers. Google has stopped supporting FeedBurner, and new or existing blogs that are not already integrated with FeedBurner can't use the service. This property will default to blank unless FeedBurner is enabled.

handle](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Blog#field-Blog.fields.handle)

A human-friendly unique string that is automatically generated from the title if no handle is sent during the creation of a blog. Duplicate handles are appended with an incremental number, for example, `blog-2`. The handle is customizable and is used by the Liquid templating language to refer to the blog. If you change the handle of a blog, then it can negatively affect the SEO of the shop. We recommend that you create a URL redirect to avoid any SEO issues.

handle](/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/input-objects/BlogUpdateInput#fields-handle)

A human-friendly unique string that is automatically generated from the title if no handle is sent during the creation of a blog. Duplicate handles are appended with an incremental number, for example, `blog-2`. The handle is customizable and is used by the Liquid templating language to refer to the blog. If you change the handle of a blog, then it can negatively affect the SEO of the shop. We recommend that you create a URL redirect to avoid any SEO issues.

Indicates whether readers can post comments to the blog and if comments are moderated or not. Possible values are:

Show commentable properties

* **no (default)**: Readers cannot post comments to blog articles.
* **moderate**: Readers can post comments to blog articles, but comments must be moderated before they appear.
* **yes**: Readers can post comments to blog articles without moderation.
