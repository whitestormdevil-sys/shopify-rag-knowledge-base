The Province resource represents the sales tax that's applied to orders based the sub-regions of a country. Sub-regions might include counties, emirates, governorates, prefectures, provinces, regions, states, and territories.

![](/assets/api/reference/province.png)

You can use the Province resource to retrieve and update [available sub-regions](#countries-that-have-provinces-in-shopify) for only the countries that a shop owner has added to a shipping zone. Merchants add countries to a shipping zone from the **Shipping** page of their Shopify admin.

For information on accessing the tax information for an entire country, including its provinces, see the [Country](/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/country) resource.

Caution

As of version 2020-10, you can no longer update custom tax values for the Province resource.

## The Province resource

[Anchor to](/docs/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/province#resource-object-properties) 

### Properties

---

code

The standard abbreviation for the province.

---

country\_id

The ID for the country that the province belongs to.

---

id

The ID for the province.

---

name

The full name of the province.

---

shipping\_zone\_id

The ID for the shipping zone that the province belongs to.

---

tax

The sales tax rate to be applied to orders made by customers from this province.

---

tax\_name

The name of the tax for this province.

---

tax\_type

The tax type. Valid values: `null`, `normal`, `harmonized`, or `compounded`.

A harmonized tax is a combination of provincial and federal sales taxes.

Normal and harmonized tax rates are applied to the pre-tax value of an order, but a compounded tax rate is applied on top of other tax rates.
For example, if a $100 order receives a 5% normal tax rate and a 2% compound tax rate, then the post-tax total is $107.10 (`(100 x 1.05) x 1.02 = 107.1`).

---

tax\_percentage

The province's tax in percent format.
