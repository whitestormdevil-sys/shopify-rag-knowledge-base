# Gift Card

Ask assistant

Requires `gift_cards` access scope.

**Requires `gift\_cards` access scope.:**

Note

You need to contact Shopify Support to request the `write_gift_cards` and `read_gift_cards` [access scopes](/docs/admin-api/access-scopes).

**Note:** 


You need to contact Shopify Support to request the `write_gift_cards` and `read_gift_cards` [access scopes](/docs/admin-api/access-scopes).

A gift card is an alternative payment method. Each gift card has a unique code that is entered during checkout.
Its balance can be redeemed over multiple checkouts. Optionally, a gift card can assigned to a specific customer.
Gift card codes cannot be retrieved after they're created—only the last four characters can be retrieved.

You can use the GiftCard resource to create, retrieve, and update gift cards for a store. After a gift card is
created, only the expiry date, note, and template suffix can be updated.

Note

You can't delete gift cards, but you can disable them. You can't enable gift cards that were previously
disabled.

**Note:** 


You can't delete gift cards, but you can disable them. You can't enable gift cards that were previously
