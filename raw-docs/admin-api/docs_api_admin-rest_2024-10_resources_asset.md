The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

Requires `themes` access scope.

**Requires `themes` access scope.:**

Note

Starting with Admin API 2023-04, if an app distributed through the Shopify App Store uses the Asset resource to create, edit or delete a theme's asset, you need to request the required protected access scope. In most cases, you shouldn't use the Asset resource. To learn more about when you can use the Asset resource, and how to migrate, refer to the [Asset resource](/docs/apps/online-store/other-integration-methods/asset).

Theme assets are the individual files that make up a shop's theme.

![](/assets/api/reference/asset.png)

A theme's assets include its templates, images, stylesheets, and extra snippets of code. They are arranged among the theme's directories, such as **layout**, **templates**, and **assets**. You can use the Asset resource to add, change, or remove asset files from a shop's theme. For a complete list of theme directories, refer to [*Theme architecture*](/themes/architecture).

To learn how to create your own theme, see [*Building themes*](/concepts/themes).
