**Multiple access scopes needed — refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.:**

You can use the `Fulfillment` resource to view fulfillments for an order or a [fulfillment order](/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentorder).
A fulfillment order represents a group of one or more items in an order that will be fulfilled from the same location. A fulfillment represents work that is completed as part of a fulfillment order and can include one or more items.
You can use the `Fulfillment` resource to manage fulfillments for fulfillment orders.

![](/assets/api/reference/fulfillment_relationships.png)

This resource is typically used in apps that perform shipping-related actions, such as making tracking and delivery updates, or creating additional shipments as required for an order or fulfillment order.

Each fulfillment supports a single tracking number. If you need to use multiple tracking numbers, then you should create separate fulfillments.

* **number**: (string) The tracking number for the fulfillment.

  The tracking number will be clickable in the interface if one of the following applies
  (the highest in the list has the highest priority):

  + Tracking URL provided in the `url` field.
  + [Shopify-known tracking company name](#supported-tracking-companies)
    specified in the `company` field.
    Shopify will build the tracking url automatically based on the tracking number specified.
  + The tracking number has a Shopify-known format.
    Shopify will guess the tracking provider and build the tracking url based on the tracking number format.
    Not all tracking carriers are supported, and multiple tracking carriers may use similarly formatted tracking numbers.
    This can result in an invalid tracking URL.
    It is highly recommended that you send the tracking company and the tracking URL.

  Note

  With the REST API, you can set only one tracking number and one tracking URL per fulfillment.
  If you send multiple shipments with one fulfillment,
  you may want to specify tracking numbers and tracking URLs for all of them.
  You can do it with the equivalent GraphQL
  [fulfillmentCreate](/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentCreate)
  and [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate](/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate)
  mutations.

  **Note:**  

  With the REST API, you can set only one tracking number and one tracking URL per fulfillment.
  If you send multiple shipments with one fulfillment,
  you may want to specify tracking numbers and tracking URLs for all of them.
  You can do it with the equivalent GraphQL
  [fulfillmentCreate](/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentCreate)
  and [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate](/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate)
  mutations.
* **url**: (string) The URL to track the fulfillment.

  The tracking URL is displayed in the merchant's admin in the order page.
  The tracking URL is displayed in the shipping confirmation email, which can optionally be sent to the customer.
  When accounts are enabled, it is also displayed in the customer's order history.

  The URL must be an [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) and
  [RFC 3987](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987)-compliant URI string.
  For example, `https://www.myshipping.com/track/?tracknumbers=TRACKING_NUMBER` is a valid URL.
  It includes a scheme (`https`) and a host (`myshipping.com`).
  If you do not provide a scheme (`http` or `https`), then `http` will be substituted.

Create a fulfillment with a tracking number of a Shopify unsupported tracking carrier,
and therefore with a tracking url provided.

Create a fulfillment with a tracking number provided.
Tracking url and tracking company name will be determined automatically as the tracking number format
unambiguously maps to a supported company (UPS).

Create a fulfillment for all fulfillment order line items if `fulfillment_order_line_items` is left blank

Create a fulfillment for the fulfillment order line items specified

Create a fulfillment without tracking info. Tracking numbers can be set later with the `/admin/api/API_VERSION/fulfillments/FULFILLMENT_ID/update_tracking.json` endpoint.

  (the highest in the list has the highest priority):

  + Tracking URL provided in the `url` field.
  + [Shopify-known tracking company name](#supported-tracking-companies)
    specified in the `company` field.
    Shopify will build the tracking url automatically based on the tracking number specified.
  + The tracking number has a Shopify-known format.
    Shopify will guess the tracking provider and build the tracking url based on the tracking number format.
    Not all tracking carriers are supported, and multiple tracking carriers may use similarly formatted tracking numbers.
    This can result in an invalid tracking URL.
    It is highly recommended that you send the tracking company and the tracking URL.

  Note

  With the REST API, you can set only one tracking number and one tracking URL per fulfillment.
  If you send multiple shipments with one fulfillment,
  you may want to specify tracking numbers and tracking URLs for all of them.
  You can do it with the equivalent GraphQL
  [fulfillmentCreate](/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentCreate)
  and [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate](/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate)
  mutations.

  **Note:**  

  With the REST API, you can set only one tracking number and one tracking URL per fulfillment.
  If you send multiple shipments with one fulfillment,
  you may want to specify tracking numbers and tracking URLs for all of them.
  You can do it with the equivalent GraphQL
  [fulfillmentCreate](/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentCreate)
  and [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate](/docs/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate)
  mutations.
* **url**: (string) The URL to track the fulfillment.

  The tracking URL is displayed in the merchant's admin in the order page.
  The tracking URL is displayed in the shipping confirmation email, which can optionally be sent to the customer.
  When accounts are enabled, it is also displayed in the customer's order history.

  The URL must be an [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) and
  [RFC 3987](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3987)-compliant URI string.
  For example, `https://www.myshipping.com/track/?tracknumbers=TRACKING_NUMBER` is a valid URL.
  It includes a scheme (`https`) and a host (`myshipping.com`).
  If you do not provide a scheme (`http` or `https`), then `http` will be substituted.
