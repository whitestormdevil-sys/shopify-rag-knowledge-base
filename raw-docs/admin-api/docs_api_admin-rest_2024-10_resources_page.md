The REST Admin API is a legacy API as of October 1, 2024. Starting April 1, 2025, all new public apps must be built exclusively with the [GraphQL Admin API](/docs/api/admin-graphql). For details and migration steps, visit our [migration guide](/docs/apps/build/graphql/migrate).

# Page

Ask assistant

Requires `content` access scope.

**Requires `content` access scope.:**

In addition to an online storefront, Shopify stores come with a tool for creating basic HTML web pages. Store owners can create any number of pages to hold static content, such as an **About us** page, a **Contact us** page, or a page with customer testimonials.

These web pages are represented by the Page resource, and their HTML content is contained in the value of the `body_html` property. The Page resource lets you retrieve, create, update, and delete web pages for a store.

Pages are meant to be used for long-term, static content that rarely changes. For creating content on a regular basis, use the [Blog](/docs/admin-api/rest/reference/online-store/blog) resource instead.
