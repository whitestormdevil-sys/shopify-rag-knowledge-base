Shopify helps merchants expand their business to a global audience, sell to multiple countries, and scale internationally. This means that many merchants need to sell in multiple languages and currencies.

To support this, Shopify has the [Geolocation app](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/cross-border/geolocation), which detects a customer's location and enables them to choose a currency, a language, or both. Alternatively, you can [create country and language selectors](/docs/storefronts/themes/markets/multiple-currencies-languages) to enable customers to choose their preferred options.

Additionally, you can [adapt your theme content for different markets](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/customizing-themes/store-contextualization).
