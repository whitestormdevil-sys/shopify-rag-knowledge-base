Note

Consider using [admin action UI extensions](/docs/apps/build/admin/actions-blocks#admin-action-ui-extensions) instead of admin link extensions to create easier to use, more seamless workflows for merchants.

**Note:**

Consider using [admin action UI extensions](/docs/apps/build/admin/actions-blocks#admin-action-ui-extensions) instead of admin link extensions to create easier to use, more seamless workflows for merchants.

Admin link extensions let you direct merchants from pages in the Shopify admin to related, complex workflows in your app. For example, the [Shopify Flow app](https://apps.shopify.com/flow) has an admin link extension that directs merchants to a page of the app where they can run an automation for any order:

Admin link extensions dynamically append generated URL parameters that identify the store that launched the action and the resource IDs of the currently selected or displayed resource, so you can create highly relevant experiences in your app.

## [Anchor to Migrating from admin links and bulk action links](/docs/apps/build/admin/admin-links#migrating-from-admin-links-and-bulk-action-links)Migrating from admin links and bulk action links

Admin link extensions replace both admin links and bulk action links, which were previously created from the Extensions section of your app's [Partners Dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/). Admin link extensions let you access the same functionality as admin links and bulk action links, but also give you the opportunity to localize links for users, let you manage links in your app's source control system, and manage their deployment with the Shopify CLI. To migrate to admin link extensions, follow the [tutorial](/docs/apps/build/admin/admin-links/migrate-admin-links).
