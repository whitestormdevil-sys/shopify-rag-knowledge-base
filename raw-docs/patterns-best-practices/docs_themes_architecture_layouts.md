Layouts are the base of the theme, through which all [templates](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates) are rendered.

Layouts are Liquid files that allow you to include content, that should be repeated on multiple page types, in a single location. For example, layouts are a good place to include any content you might want in your `<head>` element, as well as headers and footers.

You can edit the default `theme.liquid` layout, or you can create multiple custom layout files to suit your needs. You can specify which layout to use, or whether to use a layout at all, at the template level:

* In JSON templates, the layout that's used to render a page is specified using [the `layout` attribute](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/json-templates#schema).
* In Liquid templates, the layout that's used to render a page is specified using [the `layout` Liquid tag](/docs/api/liquid/tags/layout).

## [Anchor to Subtypes](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/layouts#subtypes)Subtypes

There are the following layout types:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **General** | General layouts can apply to all non-checkout pages.  The default layout file, which must be included in all themes, is `theme.liquid`. |
| **Checkout** | This layout type applies to all checkout pages. It's available to [Shopify Plus](https://www.shopify.com/plus?utm_source=shopify&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=checkout_liquid_layout) merchants only.   To learn more about this layout, refer to [checkout.liquid](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/layouts/checkout-liquid). |

## [Anchor to Schema](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/layouts#schema)Schema

Because layout files are the base of the theme, they should follow the structure of a [standard HTML document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure) in most cases. Most layout files also contain the following Liquid objects:

* [content\_for\_header](#content_for_header)
* [content\_for\_layout](#content_for_layout)

## [Anchor to Content](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/layouts#content)Content

Layouts allow you to include content that's repeated across multiple page types in a single location. For example, layouts might include header and footer [sections](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/sections) and [SEO metadata](/docs/storefronts/themes/seo/metadata).

Layout files are `.liquid` files, so content can be built using standard HTML and Liquid.

Layouts can access any [global Liquid objects](/docs/api/liquid/objects) and can contain the following Liquid objects:

* [content\_for\_header](#content_for_header)
* [content\_for\_layout](#content_for_layout).

Caution

These objects are required in `theme.liquid`. If references to these objects aren't included, then you can't save or update the file using the code editor or tools like Shopify CLI.

**Caution:**

These objects are required in `theme.liquid`. If references to these objects aren't included, then you can't save or update the file using the code editor or tools like Shopify CLI.

### [Anchor to content\_for\_header](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/layouts#content_for_header)content\_for\_header

The `content_for_header` object is required in [`theme.liquid`](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/layouts). It must be placed inside the HTML `<head>` tag. It dynamically loads all scripts required by Shopify into the document head. These scripts are required for features like hCaptcha, Shopify apps, and more.

You shouldn't try to modify or parse the `content_for_header` object. If `content_for_header` changes, then the behavior of your Liquid will change.

### [Anchor to content\_for\_layout](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/layouts#content_for_layout)content\_for\_layout

The `content_for_layout` object dynamically outputs the content for each [template](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates). You need to add a reference to this object between the `<body>` and `</body>` HTML tags.

## [Anchor to Usage](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/layouts#usage)Usage

When working with layout files, you should familiarize yourself with the following concepts:

* [Supporting template-specific CSS selectors](#support-template-specific-css-selectors)
* [Accessing and customizing checkout.liquid](#access-and-customize-checkout-liquid)

### [Anchor to Support template-specific CSS selectors](/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/layouts#support-template-specific-css-selectors)Support template-specific CSS selectors

You can help create CSS rules for specific templates by outputting data from the [`template` object](/docs/api/liquid/objects/template) in the `<body>` tag's class.
